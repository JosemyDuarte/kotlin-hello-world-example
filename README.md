# kotlin-hello-world-example

Project setup with a mix of Java and Kotlin which is conceived to say "Hi" to People. 

## What?

I didn't know how to setup a project with Java and Kotlin (should I use maven? gradle? SBT? npm?), since IntelliJ didn't work so well (at least for me), I create this repo to have a starting point from now for my projects with Kotlin. 

## Version

Kotlin - 1.3.10
